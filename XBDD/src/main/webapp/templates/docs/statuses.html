<h1>What Status' exist and what they mean</h1>
<h2 class="text-success">Passed <img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/pass.png"></h2>
<p>The passed status is represented by the colour green. It symbolises that the feature, scenario or step has either passed its automated test or been manually passed.</p>

<h2 class="text-danger">Failed <img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/fail.png"></h2>
<p>The passed status is represented by the colour red. It symbolises that the feature, scenario or step has either failed its automated test or been manually failed.</p>

<h2 class="text-warning">Undefined <img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/undef.png"></h2>
<p>The undefined status is represented by the colour orange. It symbolises that the feature, scenario or step has not yet been tested. This is only possible for manual tests.</p>

<h2 class="text-info">Skipped <img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/skip.png"></h2>
<p>The skipped status is represented by the colour blue. It symbolises that the feature, scenario or step has been skipped by the automated test.</p>

<h2 class="text-muted">Empty <img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/empty.png"></h2>
<p>The empty status is coloured grey and if it is given to a feature it means that the feature has no scenarios therefore cannot have a status. If it is given to a scenario it means the scenario has no steps and therefore cannot have a status.</p>

<h2 class="test-muted">Non-Existant <img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/ne.png"></h2>
<p>The non-existent status is coloured grey. It will only appear in <span class="help-link" data-doc="#merge-view">Merge View</span> and means that the feature or scenario shown does not exist in the build that the symbol is aligned with.</p>

<h2>How feature statuses are calculated</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b class="text-danger">Failed: </b>If a scenario with the feature has a failed statues</li>
	<li><b class="text-success">Passed: </b>If all scenarios within a feature that are not empty are passed</li>
	<li><b class="text-warning">Undefined: </b>If no scenarios within the feature have a failed status and a scenario within the feature has an undefined status</li>
	<li><b class="text-info">Skipped: </b>If no scenarios within the feature have a failed or undefined status and a scenario within a feature has a skipped status</li>
	<li><b class="text-muted">Empty: </b>If all scenarios within a feature have an empty status</li>
</ul>
