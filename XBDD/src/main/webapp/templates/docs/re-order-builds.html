<h1>Using the Re-Ordering page</h1>
<p>Once on the re-ordering page you can reposition builds in a few ways, keep in mind that the most recent builds should go at the <b><u>TOP</u></b> of the list.</p>

<h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
<p>You can simply drag any build to a new position in the list</p>

<h2>Move to Top / Move to Bottom</h2>
<p>By hovering over a build two buttons, Move to Top and Move to Bottom will appear.  Clicking either button will perform the respective function, so clicking Move to Top will move the build to the top of the list</p>
