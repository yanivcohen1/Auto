<h2>Preparatory steps</h2>
<p>In order to edit a scenario you must first locate the build and feature that this scenario presides in.</p>
<ul>
	<li>For help on how to access a build please read the help for <span class="help-link" data-doc="#viewing-builds">selecting a build</span></li>
	<li>For help on how to access a feature please read the help for <span class="help-link" data-doc="#selecting-a-feature">selecting a feature</span></li>
	<li>For help on how to access a scenario please read the help for <span class="help-link" data-doc="#selecting-a-scenario">selecting a scenario</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>View scenario testing information</h2>
<p>Once a scenario is selected its scenario test information will be visible, for more information about what these fields mean please read <span class="help-link" data-doc="#editing-a-scenario">editing a scenario</span></p>
<h2>Changing the status of a scenario</h2>
<p>For more information about what the statuses of a scenario mean please read <span class="help-link" data-doc="#statuses">status of scenarios and features</span></p>
<img class="help-doc-image" src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/set-steps.png">
<p>The status of individual steps in a scenario can be set by clicking on the step and the colour will change to reflect to what status you are changing the step too. The ordering of change is green red and white (for no change), this order is then repeated.</p>
<img class="help-doc-image" src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/set-status-button.png">
<p>In the bottom right hand corner of each scenario there are two buttons as show above, these buttons allow you to change the status of the scenario. They will cause the status of each of the steps of that senario to be changed to this status.</p>
<h2>Save your changes</h2>
<p>After changing the status of a scenario or status you must remember to save your changes. See the last section on <span class="help-link" data-doc="#editing-a-scenario">editing a scenario</span> for more details.</p>
