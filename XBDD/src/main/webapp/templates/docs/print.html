<h1>Accesing the Print Page</h1>
<p>You can access the print page by clicking on the "Printing Options" button on a build page.</p>
<img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/print-btn.png" class="help-doc-image" />

<h1>Feature Filtering</h1>
<p>The filter buttons at the top of the print page operate in an identical manner to the status filter buttons on the build page.  Clicking on a status "hides" any feature with that status.</p>
<img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/pFilters.png" class="help-doc-image" />
<p>You can also click on the "Hide / Show Attachments" button to toggle the visibility of attached images.</p>

<h1>Feature Selection</h1>
<img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/pFeatSel.png" class="help-doc-image" />
<p>Clicking on the "Choose Features" button will open a popup with a list of features and a list of tags.  Clicking on a feature will toggle it's selected status by fading it in or out.  Clicking on "Select All" or "Select None" will perform the respective action.</p>
<p>Clicking on a tag will <b>visually deselect that tag BUT will not deselect all feature with that tag</b>.  It will actually select only the features who have tags that are still selected.  This means that deselecting all the tags might not deselect all the features because some features don't have tags.  A tag can <b>visually</b> become selected or deselected when features are toggled.  For example, if a features has a single tag FOO and it is the only feature with that tag, when it is deselected the tag becomes deselected because not all features with that tag are still selected.  When the feature is reselected the tag is also reselected because all features with that tag are selected.</p>
<p>To apply the feature selections to the print page click on the "Make Selection" button</p>

<h1>PDF Printing</h1>
<p><b>IMPORTANT: </b>The two sections above (Feature Filtering and Feature Selection) do not affect the PDF printed version of a report.</p>
<p>Clicking on either the "View a PDF Report" or "Download PDF Report" buttons in Printing Options dropdown will generate a the report in a PDF format for easy distribution</p>

<h1>Printing in Web</h1>
<p>Clicking on "Print Preview in Web" will open a printable version of the report in your web browser, the feature filtering and selection will affect the output of this page.  You can print this page using: <pre>File -> Print</pre></p>
<p>Or the relevant keyboard shortcut (<i>Cmd + p</i> or <i>Ctrl + p</i>)</p>
<p>NOTE: In order to generate a PDF report with the feature filtering and selection active you can print out the web preview in Chrome and choose "Print to PDF" as the target in the chrome print options.</p>
