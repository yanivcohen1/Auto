<h1>Build Statistics</h1>
<p>Build Statistics are accessible on the landing page of any build. If no features are selected then the statistics are visible.  If you select a feature and want to see the statistics simply deselect the feature by selecting it again.</p>
<h2>Current Build Overview</h2>
<p>The Build Overview gives you an "at a glance" overview of which <b>features</b> have passed and which haven't in the build you are viewing.</p>
<img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/buildOverview.png" class="help-doc-image" />
<p>The example shown gives you an idea as to what the build overview shows.  We can immediately see that 5 features have passed but several failed, several haven't been tested yet and a few were skipped.</p>
<h2>Current Build Graphs</h2>
<p>The Build Graphs give a visual overview of which features have passed and which haven't as well as comparing automated features to manual features.  The word "test" used in these graphs actually means "feature".</p>
<img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/buildGraphs.png" class="help-doc-image" />
<p>In the example shown we can see that 33% of the tests passed and our build is tested 53% manually.  In an optimum build these graphs should be 100% passed.  In the case where there are no manual tests or no automated tests that specific graph will be hidden.</p>
<p>Manual tests are defined as being tests whose original test status was "undefined", for more information on test statuses look at <span class="help-link" data-doc="#statuses">Test Statuses Explained</span></p>
<h2>Past Build Graph</h2>
<p>The Past Build Graph gives you a visual idea of what the past builds of this product have been doing.</p>
<img src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/pastBuildGraph.png" class="help-doc-image" />
<p>This line graph is cumulative for each build. So the "15" undefined in this example is actually the addition of all the statuses beneath it.  Optimally you would have a solid green bar for this graph.</p>
<p>The stacking of statuses is in the following order: (from top to bottom)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Orange  = Undefined<pre class="nostyle">     </pre>------- At the top</li>
	<li>Blue      = Skiped</li>
	<li>Red       = Failed</li>
	<li>Green   = Passed<pre class="nostyle">        </pre>------ At the bottom</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example there are actually the same amount passed as undefined most of the way through.  We can also see from this graph that in the latest build one test failed that hadn't been failing previously.</p>
<p>You can also choose how many builds you see in this graph, you have pre-defined options of 10, 20, 50, 100 and All Builds.  You can also specify your own custom number of builds.</p>
