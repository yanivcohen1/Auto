<p>Testing tips are used by testers to provide guidance on how to carry out a particular step in a test. Testing tips are located in the information presented when a scenario is selected and are specific to that scenario. For more information see <span class="help-link" data-doc="#selecting-a-feature">selecting a feature</span>. The testing tips text area can be resized and also allows for the addition of markdown for more descriptive testing tips. For documentation on the markdown click <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_new">here</a>. You can toggle into view and edit mode by selecting the blue eye and pen respectively. Testing tips are carried forward between builds.</p>

For more information see <span class="help-link" data-doc="#selecting-a-feature">selecting a feature</span>. You can toggle into view and edit mode by selecting the blue eye and pen respectively.</p>
<img class="help-doc-image" src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/environment.png">
<p>The environment information is not carried forward though builds but is specific to the build that is edited. Each environment that is input is stored and when typing an auto complete drop down will appear making suggestions of environments that have been used in other builds for this product which can be selected. The drop down displays suggestions based on previous environments that contain the same string as currently input.</p>
<h2>Execution Notes</h2>
