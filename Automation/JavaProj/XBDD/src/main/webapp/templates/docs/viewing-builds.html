<h1>Viewing Builds</h1>
<h2>From the Product Page</h2>
<p>There are two ways to access builds in XBDD, you can select a build from a list of all builds for a product version, or you can jump straight to the latest build of a product.</p>

<p>You can scroll to find the Product or you can search for it using the Search Box.</p>
