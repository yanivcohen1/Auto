<img class="help-doc-image" src="{{getContext}}templates/docs/image/search-field.png">
<h2>Search Logic</h2>
<p>Matches are found if a scenario or feature contains any of the search words in the specified fields. Scenarios are only displayed if they contain one of the search words however features are displayed if they contain one of the search words or if any of there scenarios contain any of the search words. The results are then ordered based on the feature that has the most occurrences in its own content and the content of each of its scenarios.</p>
<p>When a feature is selected the feature is opened and the search box will disappear. When a scenario is selected its parent feature is opened, the scenario is scrolled to and opened. For the search box to disappear click anywhere else on the page. To bring it back click on the input search box at the top right of the page in the header.</p>
<h2>Searching for a product</h2>
