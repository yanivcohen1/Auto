# jhipsterAngular2Maven
This application was generated using JHipster 4.0.0, you can find documentation and help at [https://jhipster.github.io/documentation-archive/v4.0.0](https://jhipster.github.io/documentation-archive/v4.0.0).

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:
1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
2. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in `package.json`.

    yarn install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.


Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./mvnw
    yarn start

[Npm][] is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in `package.json`. You can also run `yarn update` and `yarn install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `yarn help update`.

The `yarn run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    yarn add --exact leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    yarn add --dev --exact @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:

Edit `src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts`file:
~~~
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
~~~

Edit `src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css` file:
~~~
@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
~~~

Note: there are still few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

### Using angular-cli

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

    ng generate component my-component

will generate few files:

   create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
   create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
   update src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts

## Building for production

To optimize the jhipsterAngular2Maven application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw clean test

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in `src/test/javascript/` and can be run with:

    yarn test


### Other tests

Performance tests are run by [Gatling][] and written in Scala. They're located in `src/test/gatling` and can be run with:

    ./mvnw gatling:execute

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the `src/main/docker` folder to launch required third party services.
For example, to start a mysql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./mvnw package -Pprod docker:build

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`yo jhipster:docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To set up a CI environment, consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page.
